# Database Backup Strategy for Society Management System

## Current State Analysis

Based on our analysis, the database contains:
- 21 residents
- 4 ledger entries
- 6 users
- Additional data in bank_statements and reconciliation_history tables

This is a relatively small database that is critical for managing society operations.

## Proposed Backup Strategy

### 1. Backup Frequency
- **Daily backups** for regular protection
- **Weekly full backups** with more extended retention
- **Monthly backups** for historical purposes

### 2. Backup Types
- **Full database backups** (complete copy of the database)
- **Incremental backups** (only changes since last backup) - for larger databases
- **Automated backup scheduling** to ensure consistency

### 3. Backup Storage
- **Local storage**: Keep recent backups on the same machine
- **Remote storage**: Store copies in cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) or network drive
- **Versioning**: Keep multiple versions to recover from different points in time

### 4. Backup Implementation Options

#### Option A: Simple File Copy
```bash
# Windows
copy society_management.db society_management_backup_YYYYMMDD.db

# Linux/Mac
cp society_management.db society_management_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

#### Option B: Using SQLite's .backup command
```bash
sqlite3 society_management.db ".backup society_management_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db"
```

#### Option C: Python-based backup script
A more robust solution using Python to handle the backup process with error handling.

### 5. Backup Retention Policy
- **Daily backups**: Keep for 7 days
- **Weekly backups**: Keep for 1 month
- **Monthly backups**: Keep for 1 year

### 6. Backup Verification
- Regularly test backup integrity
- Implement checksum verification
- Document restoration procedures

### 7. Security Considerations
- Protect backup files with encryption if they contain sensitive data
- Secure storage locations with appropriate permissions
- Consider data protection regulations

## Implementation Process

1. Choose the backup method (file copy, SQLite .backup, or Python script)
2. Set up automated scheduling (Windows Task Scheduler, cron jobs, etc.)
3. Configure backup storage locations
4. Implement retention policy
5. Test backup and restoration procedures
6. Document the process
7. Monitor backup success/failure
