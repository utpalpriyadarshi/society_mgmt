## Transaction Reversal

The application implements a comprehensive transaction reversal system that follows best accounting practices to ensure accuracy, transparency, and compliance in financial records.

### Key Features

- **Reason Documentation**: Users must select from predefined reasons and add remarks for each reversal
- **Audit Trail**: All reversals are tracked with timestamps and user information
