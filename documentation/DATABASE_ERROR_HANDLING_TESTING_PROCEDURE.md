# Database Connection Error Handling Testing Procedure

## Overview
This document outlines the testing procedure for database connection error handling in the Society Management System. The testing procedure covers all aspects of database error handling, including connection failures, timeouts, locks, corruption, and permission errors.

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. All dependencies from `requirements.txt` installed
3. A test database file (`test_database.db`)
4. Test user accounts in the database

### Setup Instructions
1. Create a clean test database:
   ```bash
   cp society_management.db test_database.db
   ```

2. Ensure test users exist in the database:
   - sysadmin (System Admin role)
   - testadmin (Admin role)
   - testuser (Viewer role)

## Test Categories

### 1. Connection Error Tests
Test scenarios where the database connection fails.

#### 1.1 Database File Not Found
**Objective**: Verify the system handles missing database files gracefully.

**Test Steps**:
1. Rename or delete the database file
2. Launch the application
3. Attempt to login with valid credentials

**Expected Results**:
- User receives a clear error message: "Database file not found. Please check the database path and try again."
- Application does not crash
- User is prompted to verify the database location or contact administrator

#### 1.2 Database Connection Failure
**Objective**: Verify the system handles connection failures gracefully.

**Test Steps**:
1. Modify database file permissions to deny read access
2. Launch the application
3. Attempt to login with valid credentials

**Expected Results**:
- User receives a clear error message: "Unable to connect to the database. Please check your network connection and try again."
- Application does not crash
- System attempts retry with exponential backoff

### 2. Database Lock Tests
Test scenarios where the database is locked by another process.

#### 2.1 Database Locked by Another Process
**Objective**: Verify the system handles database locks gracefully.

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the database file with another application (e.g., DB Browser for SQLite)
2. Launch the application
3. Attempt to perform any database operation (login, view residents, etc.)

**Expected Results**:
- User receives a clear warning message: "Database is currently in use by another process. Please close other instances and try again."
- Application does not crash
- System attempts retry with exponential backoff

### 3. Database Corruption Tests
Test scenarios where the database file is corrupted.

#### 3.1 Database File Corruption
**Objective**: Verify the system handles database corruption gracefully.

**Test Steps**:
1. Corrupt the database file (e.g., by truncating it or modifying bytes)
2. Launch the application
3. Attempt to login with valid credentials

**Expected Results**:
- User receives a clear error message: "Database file appears to be corrupted. Please contact your system administrator."
- Application does not crash
- System prevents further database operations

### 4. Permission Error Tests
Test scenarios where there are insufficient permissions to access the database.

#### 4.1 Insufficient Permissions
**Objective**: Verify the system handles permission errors gracefully.

**Test Steps**:
1. Modify database file permissions to deny read/write access
2. Launch the application
3. Attempt to login with valid credentials

**Expected Results**:
- User receives a clear error message: "Insufficient permissions to access the database. Please contact your system administrator."
- Application does not crash
- System prevents further database operations

### 5. Timeout Error Tests
Test scenarios where database operations time out.

#### 5.1 Query Timeout
**Objective**: Verify the system handles query timeouts gracefully.

**Test Steps**:
1. Modify the database context manager to use a very short timeout (e.g., 0.001 seconds)
2. Launch the application
3. Attempt to perform a database operation that takes longer than the timeout

**Expected Results**:
- User receives a clear error message: "Database operation timed out. Please try again or contact your system administrator if the problem persists."
- Application does not crash
- System may attempt retry with increased timeout

### 6. GUI Component Tests
Test error handling in specific GUI components.

#### 6.1 Login Dialog Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify the login dialog handles database errors gracefully.

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate database connection failure
2. Launch the application
3. Attempt to login with valid credentials

**Expected Results**:
- User receives an appropriate error message based on the specific error type
- Login dialog remains functional
- User can retry login after resolving the issue

#### 6.2 Resident Management Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify the resident management module handles database errors gracefully.

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate database connection failure
2. Login as an admin user
3. Navigate to the Resident Management tab
4. Attempt to perform operations (add, edit, delete, search residents)

**Expected Results**:
- User receives appropriate error messages for each operation
- Application does not crash
- UI remains responsive

#### 6.3 Ledger Module Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify the ledger module handles database errors gracefully.

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate database connection failure
2. Login as an admin user
3. Navigate to the Ledger tab
4. Attempt to perform operations (view transactions, add payment, add expense)

**Expected Results**:
- User receives appropriate error messages for each operation
- Application does not crash
- UI remains responsive

### 7. Model Layer Tests
Test error handling in the model layer components.

#### 7.1 ResidentManager Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify the ResidentManager handles database errors correctly.

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate various database errors (connection failure, timeout, etc.)
2. Call ResidentManager methods (get_all_residents, get_resident_by_id, etc.)

**Expected Results**:
- Methods raise appropriate custom exceptions (DatabaseConnectionError, DatabaseTimeoutError, etc.)
- Errors are properly propagated to calling code

#### 7.2 LedgerManager Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify the LedgerManager handles database errors correctly.

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate various database errors
2. Call LedgerManager methods (get_transactions, add_payment, add_expense, etc.)

**Expected Results**:
- Methods raise appropriate custom exceptions
- Errors are properly propagated to calling code

## Test Execution

### Automated Tests
Create a test script (`test_database_error_handling.py`) that:

1. Sets up test scenarios for each error type
2. Executes the relevant application functions
3. Verifies that appropriate exceptions are raised
4. Verifies that error messages are displayed correctly

### Manual Tests
Execute the manual test procedures outlined above, documenting:

1. Test scenario
2. Steps executed
3. Expected results
4. Actual results
5. Pass/fail status

## Test Data Requirements

### Test Database
- A separate test database file for each test scenario
- Pre-populated with test data (residents, transactions, users)

### Test Users
- sysadmin: System Admin user with full privileges
- testadmin: Admin user with management privileges
- testtreasurer: Treasurer user with financial privileges
- testviewer: Viewer user with read-only privileges

## Verification Criteria

### Pass Criteria
1. All custom exception classes function correctly
2. Database context manager handles errors appropriately
3. GUI components display correct error messages
4. Application remains stable and does not crash
5. Retry logic functions as expected for transient errors
6. Error messages are user-friendly and actionable

### Fail Criteria
1. Application crashes when database errors occur
2. Incorrect or misleading error messages are displayed
3. Retry logic does not function for transient errors
4. Custom exceptions are not raised appropriately
5. GUI components become unresponsive after database errors

## Reporting
