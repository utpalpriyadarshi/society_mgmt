This document describes the recent improvements made to the login page of the Society Management System, including the modern two-section design and enhanced user experience features.

## Overview

The login page has been redesigned to provide a more modern and user-friendly experience with a two-section layout that separates the login form from a decorative background image.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Two-Section Layout
- Left section contains the login form with all authentication elements
- Right section displays a background image of the society building
- Clean, modern design that follows current UI/UX best practices

### 2. Visual Enhancements
- Larger, more visible input fields for username and password
- Improved spacing and alignment of form elements
- Integrated society logo at the top of the form
- Consistent styling across both light and dark themes

### 3. Retained Functionality
- All existing authentication features maintained
- Password visibility toggle button
- Theme toggle (light/dark mode)
