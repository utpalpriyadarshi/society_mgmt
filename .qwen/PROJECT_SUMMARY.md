# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix database operation errors in the TOTP feature and resolve bank statement reconciliation issues in a Python/PyQt5 society management desktop application.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3, PyQt5, SQLite database
- **Key Components**: TOTP authentication, bank reconciliation with CSV/PDF import, ledger management
- **Architecture**: Desktop application with role-based access control (System Admin, Admin, Treasurer, Viewer)
- **Migration System**: Uses sequential versioned migration files in `ai_agent_utils/migrations/` directory
- **Database Schema**: Contains residents, ledger, users, bank_statements, reconciliation_history tables
- **Key Files**: 
  - `gui/reconciliation_tab.py` - Bank reconciliation UI
  - `models/bank_statement.py` - Bank statement management logic
  - `gui/login_dialog.py` - TOTP authentication implementation

## Recent Actions
1. **[DONE] Fixed TOTP Feature Database Errors**:
   - Resolved migration version conflicts (duplicate 008 files)
   - Renamed `008_fix_ledger_timestamp.py` to `009_fix_ledger_timestamp.py`
   - Applied pending migrations to add TOTP fields (`totp_secret`, `totp_enabled`) to users table
   - Verified TOTP functionality works correctly

2. **[DONE] Fixed Bank Statement Reconciliation Issues**:
   - Identified that entries weren't visible due to default date range filtering (last month only)
   - Modified reconciliation tab to load all entries by default on initialization
   - Fixed multiple syntax errors in `reconciliation_tab.py`
   - Verified bank statement entries now display correctly in the UI

3. **[DONE] Enhanced Duplicate Detection**:
   - Improved duplicate detection logic in `BankStatementManager`
   - Added string similarity checking using `difflib.SequenceMatcher`
   - Prevents importing near-duplicate entries with same date/amount but slightly different descriptions

4. **[DONE] Updated Documentation**:
   - Enhanced README.md with details about improvements made
   - Documented enhanced bank statement import with duplicate prevention

## Current Plan
1. **[DONE] Test application functionality with user feedback
2. **[TODO] Further refine bank statement PDF parsing for specific bank formats
3. **[TODO] Implement additional reconciliation features based on user requirements
4. **[TODO] Address any additional issues discovered during user testing
